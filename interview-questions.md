# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is a technology that allows us to track and save projects, so that we can have an accurate timeline of when new work was done to a given project.

  GitHub is an online site that uses git technology to allow users/ groups of users to add updates to projects, and keep track of changes in their projects.

  Researched answer: One thing I found is that Git is the actual software that allows "version control" to be possible. GitHub, is a "service" that stores its data in the "cloud", which allows the users to use the Git technology to manage their projects. Git is also stored as software on your local computer, unlike Github which is a website.



2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: <, <=, >, >=, ===, ==, !== (not sure of the names of these, i think operators?)

  Researched answer: After reviewing the syllabus, I see that the types of evaluations that would return a Boolean are "equality operators", "relational operators", and "logical operators". Equality operators are "===" and "==", relational operators are ">", "<", ">=", "<=", and logical operators are "&&", "||", and "!=". All of these types of operators, evaluate two pieces of data, on either side of them, and then determine if the statement is true or false.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is the specific place where a value is stored, on a string or an array. The index starts at zero and then goes until the end of the string/array.

  The value is what is stored at the index. In a string, this will usually be a letter or a character. In an array, the value can be any data type recognizable by the language.

  Researched answer: One helpful thing I read is that indexes can be thought of as addresses for the data, and that by accessing an index you are going to that data's "address".



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: An iteration is a complete cycle of a given process. In a for loop, this would be an iteration over a set of commands given to the loop, as long as the value at the index meets the requirement given to the for loop.

  Researched answer: One thing I learned while researching iteration was how to iterate over an array using the variable.map() method.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: There are two positions in a set of paired programmers. The "driver", is the one entering actual code onto their computer. They open the folder in their terminal, make the physical changes, and then push the changes onto GitHub to merge.

  The second position is "navigator". The navigator supports the driver by checking for syntax errors, and researching topics/ ways to complete problems.

  Researched answer: Something helpful information I came across was the idea of setting ground rules at the beginning of a project, when paired programming. Deciding ahead of time how often to switch positions, how long to work for without a break, and maybe even a plan on how to name variables might be a good practice.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Doing multiple repetitions on the GitHub cycle was super helpful. Especially the graphic that Austin drew on his whiteboard to illustrate the relationship between branches and "main", made things a lot clearer.
  Also, walking through the steps to find all of the information on the syllabus and lecture examples made it easy to locate information.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. GitHub pull request: This allows project managers or other tech leads to know that you have made changes to a project. You'd submit a pull request to have your code reviewed before merging it to the source of truth.

2. Higher Order Functions: This is a way to nest a function within a function. You can pass a function as the argument, in a higher order function. Looking at the map example, this helps us achieve desired outputs easier than with regular for loops.

3. Jest: Jest is a technology that allows us to test functions within our terminal. You can pass it the name of a function and your expected outputs and it will tell you if the test passed, or give you an error message you can use for debugging.

4. Objects: Objects are collections of data that take keys and values, or functions. The key is associated with the value similarly to an index being associated with a value, in a string or array. You can also use objects to destruct an array into individual variables.

5. Classes: This is a type of function that lets you verify desired outputs by inputing data and then calling on the class to check. Looks like you can use it to increment numbers and other tasks. I am actually very excited for this lecture. This looks really interesting.
